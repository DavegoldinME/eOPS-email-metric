## 🧩 What is eOPS?

**eOPS (Email On-base Plus Slugging)** is a simple, weighted metric that blends *reach* and *engagement* to give a more complete view of email campaign performance.

Inspired by baseball’s **OPS (On-base Plus Slugging)**, which measures both how often a player gets on base *and* how much power they hit with, **eOPS** does the same for email campaigns — combining *opens* and *clicks* into one clarity metric.

## ⚙️ Formula

\[
\text{eOPS} = (\text{Open Rate} × 0.5) + (\text{Click-to-Open Rate} × 1.5)
\]

or in shorthand:

\[
\text{eOPS} = (\text{OR} × 0.5) + (\text{C2O} × 1.5)
\]

## 💡 Why It Matters

Traditional metrics — **Open Rate** and **Click Rate** — tell separate stories.  
eOPS connects them, producing a single measure that captures both *attention* and *action.*

| Metric | Meaning | Weight | Why |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|
| **Open Rate (OR)** | How often recipients open your email | ×0.5 | Common, low effort |
| **Click-to-Open Rate (C2O)** | How often openers engage by clicking | ×1.5 | Rare, high intent |

Clicks are worth roughly **3× more** than opens because they signal decision and intent, not just awareness.  
This mirrors baseball logic: slugging (power) matters more than simply getting on base.

## 📊 Example

| Campaign | Open Rate | C2O | eOPS |
|-----------|------------|-----|------|
| A – Broad & Catchy | 50% | 10% | 40 |
| B – Niche & Targeted | 30% | 25% | 52.5 |
| C – Transactional | 60% | 5% | 37.5 |
| D – Story-driven | 45% | 20% | 52.5 |

Campaigns **B** and **D** outperform because they balance reach and engagement. They don’t just get opened — they move people.

## 🧠 Interpreting eOPS

- **Higher eOPS = Better overall campaign performance.**  
- Tracks both *visibility* (opens) and *effectiveness* (clicks).  
- Makes campaigns comparable across different audiences and list sizes.  
- Simple enough for non-marketers, rigorous enough for analysts.

## 📚 Context

Baseball’s OPS became a mainstream stat in the 1990s when teams realized batting average didn’t tell the whole story.  
Email marketers face the same issue today.  
eOPS offers the same kind of clarity — one number that blends consistency and impact.
